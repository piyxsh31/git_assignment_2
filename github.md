# 8 Features of GitHub

## 1. Version Control
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in source code. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without losing previous versions.

## 2. Repositories
Repositories (repos) are storage spaces for projects. They contain code, files, documentation, and version history. Repositories can be public or private.

## 3. Branching
Branching allows developers to create separate versions of a project to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch.

## 4. Pull Requests
Pull requests allow developers to propose changes to a repository. Team members can review, discuss, and approve changes before merging them into the main branch.

## 5. Issues Tracking
GitHub provides an issue tracking system to report bugs, suggest features, and manage tasks within a project.

## 6. GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is an automation tool that supports Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It helps automate testing and deployment workflows.

## 7. Collaboration Tools
GitHub supports team collaboration through code reviews, discussions, project boards, and notifications.

## 8. Documentation with README
Each repository can include a README.md file written in Markdown format to explain the project, installation steps, and usage instructions.
